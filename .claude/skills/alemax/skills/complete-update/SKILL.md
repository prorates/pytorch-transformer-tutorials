name: complete-update
description: Project-side completion of a meta delivery — run from the PROJECT's own Claude session. Reads the meta side's `.local/HANDOFF.md`, finds the update branch, says whether to cherry-pick or merge, reports the bootstrap collision, the `ci.yml` jobs belonging to a stack this project does not have, and the paths the delivery says meta no longer ships. This session then does what meta cannot: resolve conflicts with local context, re-lock, reconcile settings, run the tests, push. The project never clones the meta-repo. Consumer half of `/alemax:update-skills`.

## Wraps

`alemax update <subcommand>` — `context`, `handoff`, `locate`, `citrim`, `stale`, each
with `--json`. The shipped entry point is
`.claude/skills/alemax/skills/complete-update/scripts/update.py`; run it from the project
root with `uv run --script`, or `python3` in its place. It reads and reports; every
mutation below is a `git` line this session runs deliberately.

Behaviour — exit codes, what each subcommand decides, why — is in
`openspec/specs/alemax-plugin-package/spec.md` and the module's own docstrings. This body
does not restate it, because the two copies drift and the restatement is what a session
reads first.

## What you are looking at

The delivered branch shares no history with your `main` on purpose. A broadcast branch is
`[base @ your pin] <- [update @ meta current]`: cherry-picking the tip makes its parent the
3-way merge base, so a class-M file you never customised applies cleanly and one you
genuinely edited raises real conflict markers. **A conflict here is a question, not a
failure** — meta cannot know why your copy differs, which is why it opens no PR and
resolves nothing. `.meta-version` is a pointer into the meta repo, not yours.

**Two things a 3-way cannot see, and only you can:** a customization that is an *absence*
(an `exclude:` you added — meta appending below it is luck, not protection), and a path
meta *stopped* shipping (propagation adds, never deletes).

## Steps

1. **Orient.** Run `context`, then `handoff`. `context` refusing means you are in the meta
   clone — stop. A missing handoff is not a stop.
2. **Locate**, and apply with the verb it names — cherry-pick a broadcast, merge a sync.
   Never merge a broadcast: it takes meta's version wholesale and drops your edits. If it
   reports several refs, use the one the handoff names; two refs can have identical trees
   and different pins, so guessing applies a stale pin with no conflict to warn you.
3. **Clear the bootstrap collision first** if `locate` reports one — `git add` and commit
   those paths, never delete them and never force the pick.
4. **Resolve**, keeping your customisation *and* folding in the update. Never auto-resolve
   a substantive conflict; that judgement is the whole reason this runs here. After a
   config-file conflict, re-read the lines *after* the closing marker — git can move a
   shared trailing line outside the markers and silently reattach it to one side.
5. **Finish per the handoff.** Re-lock if the manifest moved, then `reconcile-settings
   check`, then `citrim` and `stale` — each prints the lines to run; run them and commit.
   `stale` removes only what the handoff's § Superseded paths names.
6. **Test, push, verify, clean up.** Your own checks, then push and confirm CI — on a
   billing-capped org a red run may never have executed, which is not a code failure.
   Delete the merged branch, remove the staged worktree (it lives in *your* repo), and
   name anything meta must re-broadcast.

## Not for

Running from the meta-repo — refused at step 1. Fetching class-M content from a meta clone
by hand: the payload is in the branch, and a still-missing artifact is a meta-side
re-broadcast.
