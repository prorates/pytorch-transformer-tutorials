"""path-literal-check.py — variables, never resolved paths (claude-meta spec `claude-consistency-lint`).

A document that names a resolved absolute path names ONE machine. Read on any other
drive, or by any other operator, the instruction is silently wrong: the session goes
looking under a volume that is not mounted, or an account that does not exist. The
rule the fleet already holds in prose ("variables, never paths") failed as prose in
code and in skill bodies and held only inside a session; this is the mechanical form.

DEFAULT SCOPE — the instruction-bearing files, where a literal path is a direction a
session follows and a hit means act:

  CLAUDE.md · README.md · architecture.md   at the repo root, any case
  **/SKILL.md                               every skill, both trees, both shapes
  claude/commands/** · rules/** · hooks/**  stubs, path-scoped rules, hook programs
  bin/**                                    the shipped checkers and helpers
  <skill>/scripts/**                        a scripts/ directory beside a SKILL.md

Files scanned: `.md`, `.py`, `.sh`.

`openspec/specs/**` is NOT in the default scope, and the reason is this check's own
first run: 60 of its 61 findings landed there, and the four heaviest files —
`user-environment`, `multi-aiml-drive`, `machine-bootstrap`, `host-isolation` — are
specs whose SUBJECT is drive layout and path resolution. A resolved path in
`user-environment` is a worked example: it is the content, not a mistake, and
"resolve it from a variable" is wrong advice there. `--include-specs` widens to them,
and under it a spec finding WARNS rather than refuses — except one, below.

What counts as a hit — the IDENTITY SEGMENT test. A path rooted at `/Volumes/` or
`/Users/` is read segment by segment; the segment that follows a `Volumes` or a
`Users` component is an *identity segment* — it names one DRIVE, or one ACCOUNT.
The finding is a hit when any identity segment is CONCRETE. A segment is generic,
and passes, when it carries a placeholder or an interpolation:

  a shell/template interpolation   $VAR · ${VAR} · $(whoami) · %VAR% · {{ NAME }}
  an angle-bracket placeholder     <u> · <username> · <your-username>
  a drive-generic spelling         a segment containing NN or XX (AIML0NN)

The interpolation above is spelled with inner spaces on purpose: `broadcast-update.sh`
refuses any class-M file matching the un-spaced form as a bootstrap template, which
blocks the whole fleet broadcast. Detection is character-based, so both spellings pass.

So a placeholder drive with a placeholder account passes, and a resolved drive with a
placeholder account does not: the drive is still one machine's.

Severity follows the file's ROLE, and nothing else. The same string is a defect in
an instruction and content in a specification: `user-environment` names the operator
`slegrand` to state a requirement ABOUT that account, and `host-isolation` names their
Keychains path as the one that must not be accessed. A spec cannot state its own rule
if naming its subject is a refusal, so `openspec/specs/**` warns without exception.
In an instruction-bearing file a hardcoded account
is wrong on every drive but the one it was written on. A concrete DRIVE segment
refuses in the instruction scope and warns in a spec.

A line carrying `path-literal-ok` (an operator-stated exception) or
`path-literal-docs` (the line documents this rule, or is test data) is skipped —
the same line-local idiom `meta/scripts/hooks/system-path-rule-check.sh` already
ships, for the same reason: a rule's own worked examples and a self-test's fixtures
are not instructions, and annotating the line is cheaper and more reviewable than
teaching the matcher about docstrings and test bodies.

This does NOT collide with the `system-path-rule` (spec `alemax-skills`, hook
`meta/scripts/hooks/system-path-rule-check.sh`), which requires macOS-mediated paths
to be spelled `/Users/$(whoami)/Library/…` LITERALLY rather than through `$HOME`.
`$(whoami)` is an interpolation, so the identity segment is generic and this check
passes it. The two rules meet exactly at the account name and agree on it.

Per-repo opt-out — `.claude/path-literal-allow.txt`, one entry per line, each with a
REQUIRED trailing ` # <reason>`:

  /Volumes/AIML01/   # $HOME is redirected here; the boot-disk path is real   (path-literal-docs)
  README.md          # the bootstrap block the operator types before any var is set

An entry starting with `/` allows every finding whose literal begins with it; any
other entry allows every finding in that repo-relative file or directory prefix.
An entry with no reason is itself a refusal (E1) — an exemption nobody can read is
an exemption nobody can review. Allowed findings are printed with their reason, never
dropped silently.

Exit 1 ("REFUSE") for a refusable hit in a staged file, for every refusable hit with
--strict, and for a reasonless allow entry. Unstaged hits are warnings, so the
pre-commit hook only ever speaks about the commit in front of it. Identical literals
in one file are reported once with every line number. `--json` prints the same
findings as one object. Reads the working tree, edits nothing.
